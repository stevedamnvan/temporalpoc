# Temporal POC

This repository contains a small proof-of-concept application built with React and Temporal.

## Getting Started

From the `wealthflow` directory install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd wealthflow
npm install
npm run dev
```

To start the simple Express API that launches Temporal workflows run:

```bash
npm run server
```

A production build can be created with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built assets will be generated in the `dist` folder.
